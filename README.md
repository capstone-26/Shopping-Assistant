# Shopping Assistant

Currently this is a Django web application that runs inside a Docker container. This structure provides as a skeleton for building the rest of the application. Currently the application should run inside the provided Docker container and allow navigation between the four main pages.

## State of the Application
The application is still in a very early stage of development. We are in the process of integrating key pieces with each other in order to reach the intended functionality. Currently we are testing the applicaiton inside a docker container defined in the repo. Once the application enters a more stable state (alpha/beta), we will begin to deploy it to a live server and provide instructions on how to run it.
